title: "Shapely"
description: "Shapely is a great Python library that helps us analyse and manipulate geometries. We think it is important to include this library in Dynamo.


Unlike dynamo, shapely uses its own geometry language. Therefore, transformations must be made between each other without losing data. In this package you will find a dynamo version of shapely geometry. 


Enjoy the polygons."
