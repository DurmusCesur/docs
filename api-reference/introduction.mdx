Shapely uses a geometric language similar to Desingscript. However, unlike Dynamo, you do not need to convert each operation into geometry afterwards, so it handles even complex geometries very quickly.
In doing so, there is absolutely **no geometric loss between the transformations**.'

Only the definition of geometry has changed.
