description: '
It breaks the geometry into smaller pieces. This process divides the geometry into smaller parts for more precise analysis and calculations.


As a result of the analysis, you will find a set of points.

<Note>
The distances between the points are equal!

This equality conforms to the shape of the geometry and provides a flexible design

**The smaller the input, the more points there are.**
