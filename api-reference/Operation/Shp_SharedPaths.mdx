title: 'Shapely SharedPaths'
description: '
Determines the common paths between two geometries. This operation is used to find common edges or connections.


Geometrically, **Intersecting** and **Touching** are different.


To be more precise: if the boundaries of the geometries overlap, the two geometries are said to **Touch** each other; if the boundaries of the geometries penetrate each other, the two geometries are said to **Intersect** each other.
