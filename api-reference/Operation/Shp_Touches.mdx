title: 'Shapely Touches'
description: '
It checks whether there is any boundary contact between two geometries. This determines whether the edges of the geometries touch each other.

<Note>
Geometrically, **Intersecting** and **Touching** are different.


To be more precise: 

If the boundaries of the geometries overlap, the two geometries are said to **Touch** each other; 
If the boundaries of the geometries penetrate each other, the two geometries are said to **Intersect** each other.
